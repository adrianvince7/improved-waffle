# Improved-Waffle

## Overview

**Improved-Waffle** is a cutting-edge microservices architecture project designed to revolutionize the online shopping experience. Built on **Azure Service Fabric**, this project provides a scalable, reliable, and highly available platform for e-commerce. The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the shopping process, such as product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, payment processing, order management, and delivery tracking.

The project leverages the power of Azure Service Fabric to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and dynamic scaling. By integrating with other Azure services like **Azure Cosmos DB**, **Azure Storage**, **Azure Event Hubs**, and **Azure Functions**, Improved-Waffle delivers a seamless, secure, and user-friendly shopping experience for customers worldwide.

## Key Features

### Microservices Architecture
- **Product Catalog Service**: Manages product listings, categories, and inventory.
- **Shopping Cart Service**: Handles cart operations, including adding/removing items and cart persistence.
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments securely using multiple payment gateways.
- **Order Service**: Manages order creation, tracking, and history.
- **Delivery Service**: Tracks order delivery status and provides real-time updates.

### Azure Service Fabric Integration
- **Stateful & Stateless Services**: Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Reliable Collections**: Provides persistent and reliable storage for microservices.
- **Service Discovery**: Enables seamless communication between microservices.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically scales services based on demand.

### Azure Services Integration
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Globally distributed, multi-model database for low-latency data access.
- **Azure Storage**: Stores product images, documents, and other static content.
- **Azure Event Hubs**: Handles real-time event streaming for order updates and notifications.
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless functions for background tasks like email notifications and analytics.

### Best Practices
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Ensures clear boundaries and responsibilities for each microservice.
- **Loose Coupling & High Cohesion**: Promotes modularity and maintainability.
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Uses the right database for the right use case.
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Automated testing, deployment, monitoring, and logging for continuous delivery.
