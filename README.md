A microservices architecture project which uses Azure Service Fabric

This project is a microservice-based application that provides a scalable and reliable platform for online shopping. The application consists of several microservices that handle different aspects of the shopping process, such as product catalog, shopping cart, payment, order processing, and delivery. 

Each microservice is deployed and managed by Azure Service Fabric, a distributed systems platform that enables high availability, fault tolerance, and dynamic scaling of the microservices. The application leverages Azure Service Fabric features such as stateful and stateless services, reliable collections, service discovery, and service communication. 

The application also integrates with other Azure services such as Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Functions to provide additional functionality and performance. The application follows the best practices for microservice design and development, such as domain-driven design, loose coupling, high cohesion, and polyglot persistence. 

The application also follows the best practices for DevOps and continuous delivery, such as automated testing, deployment, monitoring, and logging. The application aims to provide a fast, secure, and user-friendly online shopping experience for customers across the globe.
